# Ecommerce Microservices Applications
**Microservice implementation with Nodejs and MongoDB**

There are 3 microservices and each has its own collection

- **Users microservice:** Creates users and manages authentication
- **Products microservice:** Creates products and manages product
- **Orders microservice:** Manages the orders and interacts with the users and products collections to retrieve data. 

You can manipulate the port numbers that the services run on on the .env file but to not forget to update the same on the Dockerfiles

## Running the applications

Update the database connection by updating the variable DATABASE_URL on all the .env files in the app folders
